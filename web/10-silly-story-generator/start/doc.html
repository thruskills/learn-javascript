  <h2 id="Steps_to_complete">Steps to complete</h2>
  <p>The following sections describe what you need to do.</p>
  <p>Basic setup:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new file called <code>js/main.js</code>, in the same directory as your <code>index.html</code> file.</li>
    <li>Apply the external JavaScript file to your HTML by inserting a script element into your HTML referencing <code>js/main.js</code>. Put it just before the closing tag.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Initial variables and functions:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>In the raw text file, copy all of the code underneath the heading 
      "1. COMPLETE VARIABLE AND FUNCTION DEFINITIONS" and paste it into the 
      top of the <code>main.js</code> file. This gives you three variables that store references to the "Enter custom name" text field (<code>customName</code>), the&nbsp;"Generate random story" button (<code>randomize</code>), and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" title="The HTML <p> element represents a paragraph of text."><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> element at the bottom of the HTML body that the story will be copied into (<code>story</code>), respectively. In addition you've got a function called&nbsp;<code>randomValueFromArray()</code> that takes an array, and returns one of the items stored inside the array at random.</li><li>Now look at the second section of the raw text file — "2. RAW TEXT 
      STRINGS". This contains text strings that will act as input into our 
      program. We'd like you to contain these inside variables inside <code>main.js</code>:
      <ol>
        <li>Store the first, big long, string of text inside a variable called <code>storyText</code>.</li>
        <li>Store the first set of three strings inside an array called <code>insertX</code>.</li>
        <li>Store the second set of three strings inside an array called <code>insertY</code>.</li>
        <li>Store the third set of three strings inside an array called <code>insertZ</code>.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Placing the event handler and incomplete function:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Now return to the raw text file.</li>
      <li>Copy the code found underneath the heading "3. EVENT LISTENER AND 
        PARTIAL FUNCTION DEFINITION" and paste it into the bottom of your <code>main.js</code> file. This:
        <ul>
          <li>Adds a click event listener to the <code>randomize</code> variable so that when the button it represents is clicked, the <code>result()</code> function is run.</li>
          <li>Adds a partially-completed <code>result()</code> function 
            definiton to your code. For the remainder of the assessment, you'll be 
            filling in lines inside this function to complete it and make it work 
            properly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Completing the <code>result()</code> function:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new variable called <code>newStory</code>, and set it's value to equal <code>storyText</code>.
     This is needed so we can create a new random story each time the button
     is pressed and the function is run. If we made changes directly to <code>storyText</code>, we'd only be able to generate a new story once.</li>
     
     <li>Create three new variables called <code>xItem</code>, <code>yItem</code>, and <code>zItem</code>, and make them equal to the result of calling <code>randomValueFromArray()</code>
     on your three arrays (the result in each case will be a random item out
     of each array it is called on). For example you can call the function 
    and get it to return one random string out of <code>insertX</code> by writing <code>randomValueFromArray(insertX)</code>.</li>
    
    <li>Next we want to replace the three placeholders in the <code>newStory</code> string — <code>:insertx:</code>, <code>:inserty:</code>, and <code>:insertz:</code> — with the strings stored in <code>xItem</code>, <code>yItem</code>, and <code>zItem</code>. There is a particular string method that will help you here — in each case, make the call to the method equal to <code>newStory</code>, so each time it is called, <code>newStory</code>
     is made equal to itself, but with substitutions made. So each time the 
    button is pressed, these placeholders are each replaced with a random 
    silly string. As a further hint, the method in question only replaces 
    the first instance of the substring it finds, so you might need to make 
    one of the calls twice.</li>
    
    <li>Inside the first <code>if</code> block, add another string replacement method call to replace the name 'Bob' found in the <code>newStory</code> string with the <code>name</code> variable. In this block we are saying "If a value has been entered into the <code>customName</code> text input, replace Bob in the story with that custom name."</li><li>Inside the second <code>if</code> block, we are checking to see if the <code>uk</code>
     radio button has been selected. If so, we want to convert the weight 
    and temperature values in the story from pounds and Fahrenheit into 
    stones and centigrade. What you need to do is as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>Look up the formulae for converting pounds to stone, and Fahrenheit to centigrade.</li><li>Inside the line that defines the <code>weight</code> variable, replace 300 with a calculation that converts 300 pounds into stones. Concatenate <code>' stone'</code> onto the end of the result of the overall <code>Math.round()</code> call.</li><li>Inside the line that defines the <code>temperature</code> variable, replace 94 with a calculation that converts 94 Fahrenheit into centigrade. Concatenate <code>' centigrade'</code> onto the end of the result of the overall <code>Math.round()</code> call.</li>
        <li>Just under the two variable definitions, add two more string 
        replacement lines that replace&nbsp;'94 farenheit' with the contents of the <code>temperature</code> variable, and '300 pounds' with the contents of the <code>weight</code> variable.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Finally, in the second-to-last line of the function, make the <code>textContent</code> property of the <code>story</code> variable (which references the paragraph) equal to <code>newStory</code>.</li>
  </ol>
